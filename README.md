# TIC-TAC-TOE Game

Welcome to the TIC-TAC-TOE game project! This project is a classic implementation of the TIC-TAC-TOE game, allowing players to play against each other or an AI with varying difficulty levels. 

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📜 Overview

TIC-TAC-TOE is a two-player game where players take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This implementation supports:
- **Player vs. Player:** Play against a friend.

  - **Medium:** Strategic moves to win or block the opponent.
  - **Hard:** Optimal play using the Minimax algorithm.
